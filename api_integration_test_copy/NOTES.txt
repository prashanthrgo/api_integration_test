In order to run this test ,

please create a folder -api_integration_test and place the script file

The tool was built using pytest. since it is robut and can be adapated to a complex API like kraken at the command line ,

- on using the command "pytest -sv --html report.html test_basic.py --capture sys -rP\"
- the html report is generated with the logs out in the project folder itself
- the API used here are based on the public endpoints - https://www.kraken.com/features/api
- Test Cases covered
    - Check Status code on the response
    _ Validate Schema of the response
    - ensure the top ask price is greater than the top bid for the depth 1
    - ensure that the timestamps received were strictly increasing over time.
    - Send invalid REST API requests or WebSockets API subscription requests and check that the requests fail with an appropriate error
      message.
    - Various JSON messages used in the API responses and check that the values have the correct data types.
        - there is flaw in my last test case logic. since i use the json.dumps, the entire messages is converted into a string and is not validated as expected .

    - Sample Report is placed as report.html in the project folder
    - intentionally left the warnings on to display the report as intended .
